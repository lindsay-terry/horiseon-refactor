# Horiseon-Refactor

## Description

The starter code for this project contained a lot of non-semantic HTML, redundant CSS, and was missing key functionality and accessibility elements.  I began by combing through the code and changing the generic div elements to appropriately named semantic elements that provided the same function to break up the code into clear sections, such as header, footer, main, and aside.  After repeating the process with the children elements, I began to look at all the classes assigned to each of the elements and noticed many had different names but the same content.  I appropriately renamed and consolidated, ensuring after each change that the page maintained the design integrity it started with.  I corrected the nonworking link and organized and commented the CSS code so all selectors of each type were grouped together in an order that made sense for the flow of the page.  I then addressed the accessibility of the page and added alternate text to all images.  After the bulk of the changes, I combed through the code again to pick out anything that could improve the webpage.  I gave it a descriptive title and adjusted the indentation so it was consistent and easy to read.  Working on this project, I learned the importance of organized thought while putting together the code and using classes effeciently: many classes had different names with the same exact content in each, and a lot of work could have been saved initially if the classes had been grouped together from the beginning.  To add another section to either the main or sidebar content would have required creating another class and typing out the same code, rather than simply adding a class and adding content.
